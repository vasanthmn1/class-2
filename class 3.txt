
difference between HTTP1 vs HTTP2

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


HTTP1.1 used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles.
HTTP2 will use binary commands (in 1s and 0s) to execute the same tasks.
HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it
HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches
